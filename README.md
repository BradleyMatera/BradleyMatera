Web dev stuff, mostly in JavaScript

Git for version control and repository management, also Netlify, Vercel, and Heroku and Docker.

JavaScript frameworks iv played with including React, Gatsby, Next.js, and React Native. Iv created components, managed state, and implemented lifecycle methods for responsive user interfaces across web and mobile projects. Actively learning TypeScript to enhance development capabilities.

I usally style with Tailwind CSS, Flexbox, Grid, and CSS animations like animeJS or ThreeJS. Back-end development with Node.js and Express.js, built a few example RESTful APIs and  them integrated with MongoDB and MySQL databases. Competent in testing using Jest for unit tests on mathematical utilities and manual debugging to resolve user interface issues.

have also worked with PixiJS for real-time graphics, WebGPU for advanced rendering, Postman for API testing, and Canvas for data visualization. Projects encompass 3D object parsing, interactive soundboards, Markdown previewers, random quote generators, and bar chart visualizations.
